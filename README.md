# ModelClash: Dynamic LLM Evaluation Duel

ModelClash is a framework for evaluating and comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) in a dynamic, competitive environment. It pits AI models against each other in creative problem-solving duels, offering an adaptive approach to benchmarking that evolves with AI advancements.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Self-Generating Challenges**: Models create and solve complex problems in real-time.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Automatically scales to match any level of AI intelligence.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Tests a broad spectrum of skills including creativity, strategy, and problem-solving.

## üéÆ How ModelClash Works

### Duel Structure

1. **Challenge Creation**: One model creates a programming challenge with test cases.
2. **Challenge Solving**: Both models, with no memory of the creation phase, attempt to solve the challenge.

Models alternate roles, ensuring fair evaluation.

### Scoring System

- Creator solves, opponent fails: Creator +3 points
- Both solve: Creator +1 point, Opponent +2 points
- Creator fails, opponent solves: Creator -1 point, Opponent +3 points

This system encourages creating challenges that are difficult yet solvable.

## üèÜ Top 5 Advantages over Traditional Benchmarks

Compared to other benchmark approaches such as [MMLU](https://github.com/hendrycks/test), [GPQA](https://github.com/idavidrein/gpqa), or [Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/), ModelClash offers:

1. **Automatic Challenge Generation**: Eliminates the need for manual challenge creation, saving time and reducing human bias.
2. **Infinite Scalability**: Adapts to any level of model capability, ensuring the benchmark remains relevant as AI technology advances.
3. **Living Benchmark**: Real-time challenge generation prevents memorization and data leakage
4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Tests both problem creation and solving abilities, providing a more holistic assessment.
5. **Extreme Diversity**: Can theoretically cover an unlimited range of problem types and domains, far beyond static benchmarks.

## üìä Example Challenges

Here are two examples of challenges generated by GPT-4o during ModelClash duels:

1. Character Sorting and Deduplication
```python
assert X("banana") == "abn"
assert X("apple") == "aelp"
assert X("racecar") == "acer"
```

2. Morse Code Converter
```python
assert X("SOS") == "... --- ..."
assert X("HELLO") == ".... . .-.. .-.. ---"
assert X("123") == ".---- ..--- ...--"
```

These examples showcase the diversity and complexity of challenges that can be created in real-time by AI models.
