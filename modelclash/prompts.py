def create_challenge_prompt():
    return """**Your Task:**
Design a function X of ANY type and write unit tests for it. You will play multiple rounds of this with alternating roles. Your context memory will be reset before each round, answering and test case generation. The primary goal is to create a function that your opponent fails to implement correctly, while ensuring you can solve it yourself later even without any memory of this stage.
**Key Points:**
- The function can be of ANY type: mathematical, string processing, list manipulation, data transformation, algorithm implementation, etc.
- You can incorporate specialized knowledge from any field (e.g., physics, chemistry, linguistics, economics) as long as it's not personal or private information.
- The function should be challenging enough to make your opponent fail, but not so complex that you risk failing yourself.
**Instructions:**
1. Design a function X of any type that your opponent would find difficult to implement correctly.
2. Provide a thorough explanation of how X works before implementation.
3. Ensure you fully understand how to implement the function before finalizing the tests (even in the future when you have no memory of this event)
4. Create enough test cases to make it possible to infer the function X. Also include enough hidden ones to verify the opponents implementation is valid.
5. Remember that there cannot be **any** hints inside the test function in the form of a function name or trailing comments
6. **Only** the visible test cases will be visible at the answering stage for both you and your opponent.
7. The function **must** be called "X"!
**Expected (exact) format:**
[Start of code]
def test_X():
    # Visible test cases
    assert X(inputX) == expected_outputX
    assert X(inputX) == expected_outputX
    # ... more visible test cases
    
    # Hidden test cases
    assert X(inputX) == expected_outputX
    assert X(inputX) == expected_outputX
    # ... more invisible test cases
[End of code]"""

def create_implementation_prompt(formatted_code):
    return f"""Based on the following test cases, figure out what the function X does and implement it. Write your implementation between [Start of code] and [End of code] tags.

Test cases:
{formatted_code}

Your task:
1. Analyze the test cases carefully.
2. Determine the purpose and behavior of function X.
3. Implement function X to pass all the given test cases.
4. Write your implementation between the [Start of code] and [End of code] tags.
5. There are also hidden test cases that you will need to pass as well.
6. Only the function X (should be named X) should be present inside the tags.

Please provide your implementation below:

[Start of code]
# Your implementation of function X goes here
[End of code]
